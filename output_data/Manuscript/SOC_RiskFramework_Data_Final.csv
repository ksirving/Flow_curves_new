Proposed project can decrease by 0.06 to 0.73 cfs.,A probability of NA means no median delta FFM value is available.,A probability of NA indicates augmented peak metric.  Not enough data for flow ecology curve peak augmentation.,Current Delta FFM is within limits. Proposed project should not change timing by more than 0.31 days later or by more than 2 days earlier.,Current Delta FFM is within limits. Proposed project should not increase by more than 0.54 cfs or decrease by more than 3 cfs.,,
